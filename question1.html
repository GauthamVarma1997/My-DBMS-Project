	<h3>Map knowledge is the key to defining an experienced siege player. Given a new map, how do you analyze it?</h3>

		<select class="selection-2"  name="q1">
			<option>Select option</option>
			<option value="a">I generally invest my time in exploring the map and analyzing it in detail, although the risk is high.</option>
			<option value="b">My analysis involves exploring the map in detail  (internal analysis) as well as breaking the windows (external view). The risk of death is very high, but the benefits are favorable in the long run.</option>
			<option value="c">My experience lies in my aiming accuracy and recoil handling. So given a new map, I stay at a location and learn the map gradually through experience.</option>
			<option value="d">My approach to analysis highly depends on peer review. I will go ahead with what my team finds essential for me to do in a situation.</option>
		</select>



	<h3>If your teammate is the sole reason behind reducing your chances of winning, how would you choose to respond?</h3>

		<select class="selection-2"  name="q2">
			<option>Select option</option>
			<option value="a">According to me it is essential to react to the situation with anger as it is highly important that the team does not repeat the mistake ever again.</option>
			<option value="b">If I know that my teammate holds good ability, I react with anger as it is expected of him to not commit such a mistake.</option>
			<option value="c">I would try to advise the player as it is necessary for him to know my point of view. If the player is new, we can’t expect much from him. </option>
			<option value="d">I do not prefer reacting to unpredictable situations as they are a common happening and learning to ignore mistakes is the best way to proceed.</option>
		</select>


	<h3>How do you interpret call-outs when it comes to Siege?</h3>

		<select class="selection-2"  name="q3">
			<option>Select option</option>
			<option value="a">Call-outs can be really annoying at times, when there is a lack of coordination between the players communicating with me.</option>
			<option value="b">Call-outs are preferable when I play with friends. While playing with strangers, I choose to give a call-out when I think it can really contribute to the team.</option>
			<option value="c">According to me, unwanted information served in a call-out can actually cause trouble. </option>
			<option value="d">Call-outs are extremely advantageous under every situation. The team you are playing with doesn’t actually affect the quality of call-outs made. </option>
		</select>

		<h3>How do strategies affect your gameplay?</h3>

		<select class="selection-2"  name="q4">
			<option>Select option</option>
			<option value="a">Strategies play a key role while defining my game plan.</option>
			<option value="b">Strategies are not really important as the quality of your game play counts.</option>
			<option value="c">Strategizing each and every situation is more important than creating an overall strategy.</option>
			<option value="d">The way you play a game is instinctive. Strategies don’t contribute to gameplay.</option>
		</select>


		<h3>How often does a 'ranked game' affect your style of playing?</h3>

		<select class="selection-2"  name="q5">
			<option>Select option</option>
			<option value="a">The style of play is never related to the kind of challenges you would be facing.</option>
			<option value="b">The style of play is heavily affected as there is a lot of pressure running through our minds</option>
			<option value="c">If we have a good team, the performance of each individual generally is the same.</option>
			<option value="d">If we approach a ranked game with an appropriate mentality, the results would be appreciable.</option>
